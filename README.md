# The Neocities Gem

A CLI and library for using the Neocities API. Makes it easy to quickly upload, push, delete, and list your Neocities site.

## Installation

### Mac OSX

If you're using OSX (or already have ruby installed), run this command:

    gem install neocities

### Ubuntu/Debian 

If you're using a Debian based system, run this command:

    sudo apt install ruby-full ruby-dev
    
Note that your distribution may have different names for the Ruby packages, such as ruby-devel on RedHat.

After install Ruby, run this command:

    sudo gem install neocities
  
### Running

After that, you are all set! Run `neocities` to see the options and get started inside the CLI. 

## Neocities::Client

This gem also ships with Neocities::Client, which you can use to write code that interfaces with the Neocities API.
